# Stickney Lineman

## Inspiration

"Wichita lineman" but in space.

## Location

Mars has two very small moons - Phobos and Deimos. This game takes place on
the slightly larger one, Phobos. It has a radius of ~11 km but is irregularly shaped.


Stickney crater is the largest crater on Phobos with a diameter of ~9 km.

It has a smaller crater Limtoc.

Phobos is described as a "rubble pile held together by a thin crust".

## Objective

Set up monitoring system for resource extraction from Phobos by putting up
pylons and cabling.

## Story

Getting messages from your partner on Mars (seen in the background).

Perhaps you learn something from their investigations on the mainland about
your mission.
